# BTell

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

BTell is a web-based tool which allows authors to write branching stories.

## Features

- Graph view of the possible story paths, and the ability to edit links between chapters directly on the graph view.
- Web-based editor for chapter with support for basic Markdown.
- Minimalist conditional expressions which allow showing or hiding branches based on previously selected branches.
- Selective text, which switches parts of the text with alternate options, based on previously selected branches.
